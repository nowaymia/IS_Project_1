# Reactor Flux Web Application

This repository contains the codebase for a web application developed as a project for evaluation. The project involves creating a web server using Reactor Flux to expose web services for managing student and professor data, along with a client application to consume these services and generate various reports.

## Overview
In this project, students are tasked with developing a web application that consists of two main components:
1. **Reactive Server**: Responsible for exposing web services for CRUD operations related to student and professor entities, as well as managing their relationships.
2. **Client Application**: Utilizes Reactive code to interact with the server, collect data, and generate reports based on specific criteria.

## Project Requirements
### Server
- Implement CRUD operations for student and professor entities.
- Manage relationships between students and professors.
- Implement logging on the server side for tracking operations.

### Client
- Retrieve data from the server using Reactive code.
- Generate reports based on collected data, saving them to specified files.
- Optimize queries for efficiency and handle network failures gracefully.
